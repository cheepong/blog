    "text": "Just wanted to share something short that was memorable for me from what I have learnt from OMSCS Bayesian Statistics. This interesting problem also striked me during a interview and I couldn’t resist not sharing it because it was quite mind-blowing for me when I first learn about it.\n\nImagine we’re presented with a coin and asked to determine its fairness. Specifically, to estimate the probability of it landing on heads. We decide to flip it 10 times to gather some data 1.\n\n\nThe coin is flipped 10 times, and the result is quite surprising: 0 heads and 10 tails.\nHow do we estimate the probability of getting a head (P(Head)) based on this result? Let’s explore this using two major statistical paradigms: Frequentist and Bayesian.\n\n\n\nThe Frequentist approach relies solely on the observed data. A common method used is Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), which finds the parameter value (in this case, P(Head)) that maximizes the probability of observing the collected data.\nFor our experiment, the estimate is the frequency of heads divided by the total number of trials:\nP(Head) = (Number of Heads) / (Total Flips) = 0 / 10 = 0\nAccording to this result, the coin will never land on heads. While this aligns perfectly with our observed data, it feels intuitively wrong. A coin has two sides, and suggesting it’s impossible for one side to ever appear seems like an overly strong conclusion from just 10 flips.\n\n\n\n\nThe Bayesian approach allows us to incorporate prior beliefs into our estimation, which are then updated by the data we collect.\n\nPrior Belief: Before we even flip the coin, we can start with a belief about P(Head). A reasonable and unbiased starting point is to assume that any probability from 0 to 1 is equally likely. This is represented by a Uniform distribution, which is a specific case of the Beta distribution: Beta(1, 1).\nLikelihood: This is the probability of our observed data (0 heads, 10 tails) given a certain P(Head). This is described by the Binomial distribution.\nPosterior Distribution: We combine our prior belief with the likelihood of our data to get an updated belief, known as the posterior distribution. When using a Beta distribution as a prior and a Binomial likelihood, the posterior is also a Beta distribution.\n\nThe calculation for the posterior is: Posterior ~ Beta(α_prior + k_heads, β_prior + n_tails) Posterior ~ Beta(1 + 0, 1 + 10) = Beta(1, 11)\nInstead of a single point estimate like the Frequentist method, the Bayesian approach gives us a full probability distribution for P(Head). To get a single number, we can calculate the expected value (mean) of this posterior distribution.\nThe expected value of a Beta(α, β) distribution is α / (α + β).\nFor our Beta(1, 11) posterior, the expected value is:\nE[P(Head)] = 1 / (1 + 11) = 1 / 12\n\n\n\nIn this scenario, the Bayesian approach provides a demonstrably more practical and intuitive answer.\nThe Frequentist result, P(Head) = 0, is an extreme conclusion based on a very small dataset. It makes the absolute claim that heads are an impossibility, which is a fragile and unhelpful inference. If the 11th flip were to be a head, the estimate would lurch from 0 to 1/11.\nThe Bayesian estimate of 1/12 is far more robust. It acknowledges the strong evidence suggesting the coin is biased towards tails, but it wisely avoids making an absolute claim of impossibility. By incorporating a prior belief (that any probability is initially possible), it provides a balanced and reasonable estimate that reflects our uncertainty. This ability to blend prior knowledge with observed data makes the Bayesian framework a superior and more common-sense tool for reasoning under uncertainty, especially with limited data."
