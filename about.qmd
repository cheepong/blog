About this blog

I'm a Data Scientist from Singapore who has recently relocated to London. My professional background includes roles at Apple, Singtel, Grab, and the Ministry of Manpower.

Currently, I'm expanding my expertise in machine learning engineering by pursuing an online Master of Science in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology (GATECH).

This blog serves as a chronicle of my journey living in London, while also being a platform for me to share my thoughts and experiences in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
